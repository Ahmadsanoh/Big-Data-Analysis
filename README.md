# Big-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the e-commerce landscape in India by examining the correlation between prices on local e-commerce sites and Amazon, consumer preferences, sales trends across different product categories, fulfillment analysis, and predictive modeling for future sales figures and customer targeting.

Key Questions Addressed:

What is the correlation between prices on local e-commerce sites and Amazon, and how does it vary by e-commerce type?
Are Indians more inclined to buy from local e-commerce sites or Amazon?
Based on the most preferred e-commerce site, which product category has the highest sales?
Which product categories experienced the highest number of cancelled orders, and what percentage of orders were cancelled for each category?
How can we analyze fulfillment of sales based on the percentage of order status and courier status?
Does the ship-service level impact the courier status?
What advice can be offered to a person intending to order a product?
How does total sales revenue vary by product category and size?
Which month recorded the highest sales, and what was the revenue earned during that month?
Can future sales figures be predicted using available data?
Can the most valuable customers be identified and targeted with personalized promotions?
Tools and Techniques:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for descriptive insights.
Statistical analysis to determine correlations and trends.
Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.
Customer segmentation and targeting strategies.
Visualization techniques to present findings effectively.

Outcome:
The project will culminate in a comprehensive analysis report detailing the insights gained from the data. Additionally, code scripts and models will be available on GitHub, providing transparency and reproducibility for future analysis or extension of the project.
